This Project Is Me dipping my toes into Genetic Algorithms and Neuroevolution.

How it Works:
1. Create a random grid of cells
2. Each cell has a color
3. Create a background color
4. Create a fitness score function
5. Allows to see which cells are more blended into the background
6. Sort based on fitness score
7. Remove the less fit half of the population
8. Duplicate the fit half with MUTATIONS***
9. Mutations are important because they will allow for reaching values no cells have.
10. Repeat.

Eventually all cells should blend in. 
Pretty basic program.
